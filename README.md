This project exists to demonstrate the problem I am experiencing with the Xerial sqlite-jdbc library when switching from version `3.45.2.0` to `3.45.3.0`

Make sure your JDK is version 22 and Maven is latest version.

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EasyG0ing1/SqliteUpgradeProblem.git
```

go into the project folder then 

```bash

```
